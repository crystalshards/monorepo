## Next Steps (Priority Order)
1. Create admin interface for shard approval and job posting management
2. Optimize performance and implement caching strategies
3. Add email notifications for job posting confirmations
4. Implement advanced search features with filters and sorting
5. Add user authentication and authorization system

## Current Code Status
- All apps have comprehensive HTTP endpoints and health checks
- Database schema is complete with proper indexing
- Development environment is ready to run
- Applications use Kemal web framework
- Background jobs configured with Sidekiq.cr
- Comprehensive test coverage with unit, integration, and E2E tests
- CI/CD pipeline with automated testing and security scanning

## Infrastructure Ready For
- Local development with `make dev`
- ✅ Container builds and deployments with automated CI/CD
- ✅ Kubernetes deployment with full infrastructure stack
- ✅ Production scaling with KEDA (scale-to-zero enabled)
- ✅ High-availability PostgreSQL with automated backups
- ✅ Redis caching and session storage
- ✅ MinIO object storage with pre-configured buckets
- ✅ Comprehensive monitoring with Prometheus/Grafana
- ✅ Automated security scanning and vulnerability detection
- ✅ Zero-downtime deployments with GitHub Actions
- ✅ Environment-specific deployments (staging/production)
- ✅ Automated testing pipeline with E2E validation

## Blockers
- Crystal compiler permission issues (worked around with Docker)
- Lucky CLI installation failed (using plain Kemal instead)

## Notes
- Repository: https://github.com/crystalshards/monorepo.git
- Following RepoMirror philosophy: commit early, iterate fast
- All apps containerized and production-ready
- Shared models library for code reuse
